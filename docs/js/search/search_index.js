techniques and features of Angular development and how to implement them.\nPlease know that this project follows Angular style guid, and all of our future Angular application should follow Angular style guid.\nFeature Modules\nThis project utilized Angular feature modules to help separate codes related to different features in their own area (each module also utilized lazy loading to decrease load time):\n\nComplex Forms Module: Demonstrate how to create a complex form the span across different components\nEnd-To-End Testing Module: Demonstrates how to perform end-to-end testing on an Angular application using Protractor\nInputs And Outputs Module: General guideline for using inputs and outputs for Angular components\nInternationalization Module: Demonstrate how to use ngx-translate\nRxJS Module: Demo the more common operators, and subjects; It does not cover everything within the RxJS library\nUnit Testing Module: Demonstrate what we are expecting when creating unit tests for different class types\nWeb Storage Module: Demonstrate how to add, update, delete, and get items using the Web Storage Api\n\nTo learn more about feature module, please read:\n\nWhat is feature module: https://angular.io/guide/feature-modules\nDifferent module type: https://angular.io/guide/module-types\nWhat is lazy loaded module: https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules\nWhat is shared module: https://angular.io/guide/sharing-ngmodules\n\nConfigurations\nOn top of the configurations created by Angular CLI, we also require some additional configurations. This section will go over all the additional configurations expected to be in every future Angular project and on everyone's machine.\nVSCode Workspace Setting\nIt is absolutely necessary for every Angular workspace to have launch and task configurations that allows for debugging npm start, npm run test, and npm run e2e. To create these configurations follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the debugger tab with Ctrl+Shift+D or by clicking the debugger icon\nIf a launch.json file doesn't already exists you should see a create a launch.json file link. Click that link, and wait until vscode gives you some options, then select one of them (it doesn't matter which one because we will be replacing the contents anyways).\nCopy the following json and replace the contents of the launch.json file with them{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"ng serve\",\n      \"type\": \"chrome\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"preLaunchTask\": \"npm: start\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:4200/#\",\n      \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n      \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\n        \"webpack:/*\": \"${webRoot}/*\",\n        \"/./*\": \"${webRoot}/*\",\n        \"/src/*\": \"${webRoot}/*\",\n        \"/*\": \"*\",\n        \"/./~/*\": \"${webRoot}/node_modules/*\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"ng test\",\n      \"type\": \"chrome\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:9876/debug.html\",\n      \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n      \"sourceMaps\": true,\n      \"pathMapping\": {\n        \"/_karma_webpack_\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n      },\n      \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\n        \"webpack:/*\": \"${webRoot}/*\",\n        \"/./*\": \"${webRoot}/*\",\n        \"/src/*\": \"${webRoot}/*\",\n        \"/*\": \"*\",\n        \"/./~/*\": \"${webRoot}/node_modules/*\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"ng e2e\",\n      \"type\": \"node\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor\",\n      \"protocol\": \"inspector\",\n      \"args\": [\"${workspaceFolder}/e2e/protractor.conf.js\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nCreate a task.json file in the same .vscode folder as your launch.json then copy and paste the following json into it{\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"npm\",\n      \"script\": \"start\",\n      \"isBackground\": true,\n      \"presentation\": {\n        \"focus\": true,\n        \"panel\": \"dedicated\"\n      },\n      \"group\": {\n        \"kind\": \"build\",\n        \"isDefault\": true\n      },\n      \"problemMatcher\": {\n        \"owner\": \"typescript\",\n        \"source\": \"ts\",\n        \"applyTo\": \"closedDocuments\",\n        \"fileLocation\": [\"relative\", \"${cwd}\"],\n        \"pattern\": \"$tsc\",\n        \"background\": {\n          \"activeOnStart\": true,\n          \"beginsPattern\": {\n            \"regexp\": \"(.*?)\"\n          },\n          \"endsPattern\": {\n            \"regexp\": \"Compiled |Failed to compile.\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nOnce this is done you should see new configuration options in your debug tab that you can choose to run. The ng serve and ng e2e configurations will work the same as the npm start and npm run e2e commands. The ng test command however will require you to still run the npm run test command because it requires a test instance to attach to. The benefit you get from all of these configurations is that you can now add breakpoints to your code base to pause code execution. Allowing you to inspect the state of your application at a given point in time. This makes debugging much easier.\nVSCode Plugins\nSince We expect everyone to utilize Visual Studio Code for Angular application development, the following are all the required VScode plugins:\n\nAngular Essentials: johnpapa.angular-essentials\nPrettier - Code formatter: esbenp.prettier-vscode\nnpm: eg2.vscode-npm-script\nnpm Intellisense: christian-kohler.npm-intellisense\nNode.js Modules Intellisense: leizongmin.node-module-intellisense\nCode Spell Checker: streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker\nGitLens — Git supercharged: eamodio.gitlens\n\nThe list can also be found in .vscode/extensions.json of this solution, please copy extensions.json file to other Angular application's .vscode folder.\nPrettier Setting\nSince we need our code formatting to be the same for everyone, .prettierrc file is expected to be present in each Angular project and the file should contain the following:\n{\n  \"singleQuote\": true,\n  \"printWidth\": 140\n}Git Configuration\nWe expect each Angular project to contain .gitignore file and .gitattributes file to standardize our git configuration.\n.gitattributes file should contain * text=auto to normalize line endings\nNPM Packages\nBesides the following packages:\n\ndependency:\nangular material\nngx-logger\nngx-translate\n\n\ndev dependency:\ncompodoc\nspectator\nfaker\n\n\n\nAll packages need to be approved before added to the project.\nAngular Log Format\nWhen logging messages, we want to keep a standard format to make it easier for our future selves to debug/troubleshoot. Therefore, we need to make sure the log message follow the format below:\n  .: \nTimestamp is the ISO string representation of when the message is logged\nLogLevel is the uppercase string representation of the message's log level\nClassName is the name of the class that logged the message\nMethodName is the name of the method that logged the message, can be omitted if and only if the method is constructor\nMessage is the actual log message; If necessary, log message should contain data to aid the debugging process\n\nThe following are some example log message:\n# Not using ngx-logger:\n2020-04-01T14:48:36.580Z DEBUG FooClass.Bar: This is an example\n\n# Using ngx-logger:\n2020-04-01T14:48:36.580Z DEBUG [vendor.js:282391] FooClass.Bar: This is an exampleNote: Timestamp and LogLevel will be automatically added to your log message when using ngx-logger\nDo keep in mind that, most likely than not, the Angular application will be deployed remotely. Thus, log messages might be our only way to figure out what went wrong. So try to keep the log messages as informative as possible while not drowning the reader.\nCode Documentation\nBasic understanding of how to create comment and different comment type is required for this section. If you need a refresher, please check out JSDoc Style Guide.\nWhen documenting code, it is crucial to meet the following expectations so that people can understand what the code suppose to do without polluting it.\nClass Comment\nClass comment should only be created for class that is a service, pipe, guard, or interceptor to help others understand purpose of the class. Following is an example class comment:\n/**\n * This service offers basic mathematical operations\n */\nexport class MathService{...}Comment for inputs and outputs\nComment should be created for properties of a component with @Input() or @Output() attribute to help others understand the purpose of those properties. Below is an example comment:\n/**\n * User ID required to retrieve user information\n */\n@Input() id: string;Method Comment\nEvery method should have a method comment, which should include:\n\nAn description of what the method does\nIf the method is complex, consider also explain why method works this way\nIf the method is a simple wrapper, the description should be simple\n\n\nIf applicable, @param, @returns, and @throws should also be present\nDo NOT leave empty comment tag around! (Except the cases were the comment tag meant to be empty)\n\n\n\nThe following is an example method comment:\n/**\n * Subtract b from a\n *\n * @param {number} a The first number\n * @param {number} b The second number\n *\n * @returns {number} Difference between a and b\n *\n * @throws {RangeError} If a or b is less than zero\n */\nsubtract(a: number, b: number): number { ... }General Expectations\nThis sections contains some general code documentation expectations that should be followed, and some additional examples.\nDescriptive names\nIn addition to following Angular naming conventions, we should also make sure the names accurately reflect the purpose and functionality of the class, method, variable, etc in a short and concise manner. The following is an example of bad names and potential fixes:\n// Bad Example:\n// Function name and parameter names not reflecting purpose and functionality of each\na(u: number[], q: number): bool {\n  return u.indexOf(q) > -1;\n }\n\n// Potential Fixes:\n// Rename method name and parameter names to be more descriptive\nisTargetInArray(array: number[], target: number): bool {\n  return array.indexOf(target) > -1;\n }Create document for complex logic\nIf code cannot be explained properly within the comments and cannot be simplified, by refactoring or otherwise, then a document should be created and linked in the comment of the code. An example can be find in AsyncMessageProcessor of old OrbitalBus.\nAvoid inline comments\nIf the code is complex enough to warrant an inline comment, consider refactor that pieces of code into its own method. Below is an example of how to avoid inline comment:\n// Bad Example:\n// Inline comment for code that is too complex\nblur(origin: number, x: number): number {\n  ...\n  // calculates Gaussian probability of x\n  const prob = Math.exp(- ((origin - x) ** 2) / (sigma ** 2) / 2.0) / Math.sqrt(2.0 * Math.PI * (sigma ** 2));\n  ...\n}\n\n// Potential Fix:\n// Move complex logic to another method and add comment to that method\nblur(origin: number, x: number): number {\n  ...\n  const prob = gaussian(x, origin, sigma);\n  ...\n}\n\n/**\n * Calculate Gaussian probability of x\n *\n * @param {number} x Target\n * @param {number} mu Mean of the distribution\n * @param {number} sigma Variance of the distribution\n *\n * @returns {number} Gaussian probability\n */\ngaussian(x:number, mu: number, sigma: number) {\n  return Math.exp(- ((origin - x) ** 2) / (sigma ** 2) / 2.0) / Math.sqrt(2.0 * Math.PI * (sigma ** 2));\n}If refactoring cannot be done or the code is already as simple as it can be, consider following advise of create document for complex logic section.\nBad comment examples\nPeople are able to extract the information provided by the following comment from the class name alone, thus the comment is useless:\n/**\n * Service that do math\n */\nexport class MathService{...}Below is an ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE comment! DON'T ever do this!\n/**\n * Join the provided two whole numbers, can be positive, negative, or zero,\n * to compute the total sum\n *\n *  Algorithm: Works by utilizing the cascade of adders (an arithmetic logic units)\n *     within the processor to perform addition on the 32 bits two's complement binary\n *     number together then translate the binary number back to a base 10 number\n *\n *  Modification History: last edited by Bob on April 1st to increase performance by\n *     removing extra space\n *\n * @param {number} a The first whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero\n * @param {number} b The second whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero\n *\n * @returns {number} The total amount of the two natural numbers combined\n */\nadd(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a + b;\n }Too much unnecessary information! The code already tell us how it works, we don't need paragraphs to explain what a + b does and we don't need to know Bob remove a space (we have git).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

components. All techniques used in this module are derived from the following tutorials, please give them a read for more indepth understanding:\n\nhttps://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms\nhttps://angular.io/guide/dynamic-form\nhttps://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules\n\nThis module allow the user to create a team with at least one players in the team.\nFolder structure of this module loosely follows the Angular style guid.\nComponents\nThis module contains 5 components:\n\nComplexFormComponent is the root component that stitches everything together\nTeamNameInputComponent is used to retrieve team name from user\nPlayerListComponent is created for adding and removing player from the provided form array\nPlayerListItemComponent is used to retrieve player name and player type from user\n\n\nResultComponent is a dialog component for display the retrieved team information\n\n\n\nModels\nThis module contains serval models to help represent the team information as form inputs:\n\nInputBase represents a basic html input or select\nStores information such as FormControlName as key, validators of needed for the input as validators, label of the input as label, etc\n\n\nTeam represents the form inputs used to retrieve team information, using InputBase\nPlayer represents the form inputs used to retrieve player information, using InputBase\nPlayerType is a enum used for representing different player type\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\nThis module only have require one service, which is TeamControlService, to translate Team to and from FormGroup, and also to translate Player to and from FormGroup.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/samples/end-to-end-testing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/samples/end-to-end-testing.html","title":"additional-page - End-To-End Testing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nE2E Module\nThis lazy loaded feature module is created to demonstrate how to perform end-to-end testing on angular applications using Protractor\nFolder structure of this module loosely follows the Angular style guide. and the Protractor style guide\nInstructions To Run The E2E Tests\nNormally when angular creates the project for you it generates the following command in your package.json to run your end-to-end tests, ng e2e. However when this command is run you will have to wait for the for your application to build and serve before the end-to-end tests can run. This build step really slows down end-to-end testing. That is why, in this module we have modified the command to be ng e2e --dev-server-target. This will cause the end-to-end test runner to use an already built and served instance of the application to run the tests against. However this also means you must have an instance of the application running to execute this command. So the steps to run the tests in the module are:\n\nRun the command npm start to start an instance of the application\nRun the command npm run e2e in another terminal to start your end-to-end tests.\n\nThis changes allows us to run multiple end-to-end test quicker.\nProtractor\nProtractor is an end-to-end framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser mimicking a real user. Protractor is automatically installed when creating angular applications with the ng create command. If for some reason Protractor is not installed please see the Protractor website for more information.\nHere are some things to keep in mind when writing end-to-end tests with Protractor:\n\nUse Page Objects to interact with a page under test.\n\nPage Objects are models of your application UI that your tests interact with. They provide functions that your test suites can use to perform actions or observe changes in your UI. It can also expose properties that reference elements of this UI.\nFor example: We may have a view with a button that when clicked it opens a popup containing a certain message. In order to perform an end-to-end test of this we could create a Page Object for this view and create two functions. One would be responsible for clicking the button and the other one would be responsible for returning the message displayed in the popup. Our Page Object could also expose the popup element as a property so our test suite can check to see if the popup has been displayed after clicking the button.\nThis module contains a similar example as the one described above\n\n\nWe do this because Page Objects are reusable, and help decouple the test logic from implementation details. This way if the implementation changes we should only have to update our Page Objects and not our test files that use them.\n\n\nDo not using expect() in Page Objects\n\nIt's not the responsibility of our Page Objects to make assertions. That logic should only be done within our test suites.\n\n\nDue to Angular we don't have access to the following locator strategies:\n\nby.model()\nby.binding()\nby.repeater()\n\n\nPrefer using $ and $$ locators.\n\n$ is used to select a single elements using css and is a synchronous operation\n$$ is used to select multiple elements using css and is a asynchronous operation\n\n\nDon't use the xpath locator strategy\n\nThis is a very strong rule created by the Protractor team and should be followed at all times.\n\n\nRemember to always navigate to the page under test before testing\n\nExample:\ndescribe('...', () => {\n  beforeAll(() => {\n    page = new Page();\n    page.navigateTo(); // a navigation function implemented in the Page Object\n  });\n\n  //Test Suite Code....\n});\n\n\nUse the Jasmine setup and tear down callbacks (example: beforeEach()) to setup test scenarios and perform any cleanup to prevent your end-to-end tests from polluting each other.\n\nexample: If you have an input you should probably make sure that it is cleared before using it again to ensure you don't just concatenate onto the previous input value. Unless this is the behavior you are trying to achieve.\n\n\nAll actions performed on an element are asynchronous. Actions are things such as clicking a button or checking to see if a certain element has been displayed.\n\nFor more information on actions take a look at the functions listed under the protractor documentation on WebElement or this protractor api cheat sheet\n\nexample:\nconst el = $('.myClass');\n// A click action that returns a Promise\nel.click().then(() => console.log('click action complete'));\n\nel.sendKeys('some text');\n\n// Returns a Promise\nel.isDisplayed().then((result) => console.log('el is displayed: ', result));\n\n\n\nComponents\nThis module contains 4 components:\n\nE2eComponent is the parent component for the MessageInputComponent and the MessageListComponent. Its only purpose is to render these two components in a 2 column layout\nDeleteDialogComponent is the component that renders when the delete dialog is opened. It acts as a confirmation dialog for deleting a message from the list\nMessageInputComponent is the component that contains the input elements for submitting a new message. It is dependent on the MessageService, using it to send to messages to any components listening to the services observable\nMessageListComponent is the component responsible for displaying the messages emitted by the MessageService. It listens to the services observable and stores the incoming messages into an array which are then rendered by its template. Its also responsible for opening the delete dialog when a user clicks on the delete dialog and removing the message from the message list when the user clicks confirm on the delete dialog.\n\nServices\nThere is one service contained in this module:\n\nMessageService is the service responsible emitting message strings to any component listening to its observable. It contains a function that can be used to send a new message string through its observable.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/samples/i18n.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/samples/i18n.html","title":"additional-page - i18n","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nInternationalization (i18n) Module\nDemonstrate how to use ngx-translate in a lazy loaded feature module. All techniques used in this module are derived from the following tutorials, please give them a read for more indepth understanding:\n\nhttps://github.com/ngx-translate/core\nhttps://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit/tutorials/how-to-translate-your-angular8-app-with-ngx-translate\nhttps://stackblitz.com/github/ngx-translate/example\n\nThis module display a card with language switch button.\nFolder structure of this module loosely follows the Angular style guide.\nComponents\nThis module contains 2 components:\n\nI18nComponent is the root component where the language switch functionality resides and also showcase a few ways to retrieve translation value\nContentCardComponent is used to display the card body and also showcase the most basic usage of the translation service\n\n\n\nModels\nThis module only contains Language enum to represent the available languages.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/samples/input-and-output.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/samples/input-and-output.html","title":"additional-page - Input and Output","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nInputs and Outputs\nThe purpose of this module is to serve as a general guideline for using inputs and outputs for Angular components and provide some examples using Inputs and Outputs. Inputs and outputs are one of the ways components are able to interact with other components. There are other ways such as using the ViewChild decorator to directly interact with a child component, but this couples the components and makes reusing a component difficult. So it is recommended to use inputs and outputs, or services for component communication.\nFor more information on inputs and outputs see the angular documentation on component interaction.\nFolder structure of this module loosely follows the Angular style guide.\nGuidelines\n\nType your input/output if they aren't already implicitly typed.\n\nExample: @Input() myInput: string.\nThis is especially useful with the release of Angular 9 since the ivy compiler can perform ahead of time checks on the types of the data you bind to your input and output\n\n\nUse the @Input and @Output decorator instead of declaring them within the @Component decorator.\n\nAvoid using inputs and outputs when you need components to interact through multiple levels within your applications hierarchy, or if you need to facilitate an interaction between sibling components. Instead consider using a service for communication.\n\nLong chains of inputs and outputs gets confusing as your application hierarchy gets larger and poses a greater risk of introducing unexpected bugs when you modify a component within the chain.\n\nFor example: If I have a NotificationDisplayComponent that displays notification messages that can be triggered from anywhere in the application I could structure my application to propagate notifications up to a root component to store and send as a list to my NotificationDisplayComponent like so:\n[RootComponent] ---input----> [NotificationDisplayComponent]\n      ^\n      |---- output ----- [ChildComponent]\n                              ^\n                              |----output----[ChildComponent]but it would be better to create a service that components on any level could interact with and the NotificationDisplayComponent could listen to\n  [NotificationDisplayComponent] \n\n\nUse setter functions for intercepting values from an input when you only need to watch a single input at once. If you wish to execute code after changes occur in multiple inputs then you should use the ngOnChanges life cycle hook. There is also an example of listening to multiple inputs within this module.\n\nExample: you may have a component that wants to remove any white spaces at the start or end of a string inputtrimmedInput: string = '';\n@Input()\nset myInput(input: string) {\n  this.trimmedInput = input.trim();\n}\n\n\nAvoid aliasing them. Example: instead of @Input('myInput') input: string do @Input() myInput: string.\n\nAvoid prefixing your outputs with on. Angular automatically provides an alternative accessor for outputs prefixed with on- so if you were to name an output onClick you would also get an alias on-onClick. This is a minor guideline but is recommended to avoid by the Angular team.\n\nAvoid creating an output that emits EventEmitters. It can cause memory leaks if you forget to clean up your subscriptions to the previously emitted EventEmitters.\n\nExample: @Output() output: EventEmitter> // don't do this\n\n\n\nComponents\nThis module contains 4 components:\n\nParentComponent is the root component that will be communicating to all other components using their inputs and outputs.\nTextInputComponent is a component that takes user input through a text input html tag and emits that value through an @Output property.\nUppercaseTextComponent is a component that takes text through an @Input and turns it into an uppercase format by intercepting the incoming value using a setter function.\nMultiInputExampleComponent is a component has two number inputs and displays the sum and product of these values. However it only updates the product value if both numbers have changed during the same changed detection step (something that is much harder to achieve through setter functions and probably shouldn't be done with setter functions). This is to show how you can listen to all input changes using the ngOnChanges.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/samples/rxjs.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/samples/rxjs.html","title":"additional-page - RxJs","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nRxJS Module\nThis lazy loaded feature module is created to demonstrate how to create, subscribe to, and transform Observables and Subjects. While this module aims to demo the more common operators, and subjects it does not cover everything within the RxJS library. For more information please see the RxJS documentation and the Learn RxJS Documentation\nFolder structure of this module loosely follows the Angular style guide.\nSubjects\nWithin the RxJS library are a special type of Observables called Subjects. Subjects are similar to Observables except they can have multiple observers and owners of the subject can emit new values onto the subject after the creation of a subject using the subject's next() function. There are four different types of subjects:\n\nSubject: The vanilla subject, no state is stored, no history is kept. It just acts as a multicasted Observable.\nBehavior Subject: This subject stores its state. When a new observer subscribes to this subject it will be given the current state (if there is any). Example:\n\nconst subject = new BehaviorSubject();\nsubject.subscribe(data => console.log(data)); // Nothing will be emitted to this observer since the state of the behavior subject wasn't initialized on creation.\n\nsubject.next(1); // the subject emits 1\n// observer1: console.log(1)\n\nsubject.subscribe(data => console.log(data)) // The subject will emit the value 1 to this observer\n//observer2: console.log(1)\n\nsubject.next(2);\n// observer1: console.log(2)\n// observer2: console.log(2)\n\nReplay Subject: This subject stores a history of emitted values. On creation you can define the buffer limit of its history but by default there is no limit on its buffer size. Example:\n\nconst subject = new ReplaySubject();\nsubject.subscribe(data => console.log(data)); // Nothing will be emitted because there is no history\n\nsubject.next(1); // the subject emits 1\n// observer1: console.log(1)\nsubject.next(2);\n// observer1: console.log(2)\n\nsubject.subscribe(data => console.log(data)) // The subject will emit the value 1 to this observer\n//observer2: console.log(1)\n// observer2: console.log(2)\nAsyncSubject: Similar to the vanilla subject but the async subject only emits the last value to observers on completion.\n\nThis module only has examples of the replay and behavior subject. For more information on subjects please see the RxJS documentation and the Learn RxJS Documentation\nComponents\nThis module contains 5 components:\n\nDashboardComponent is the root component that allows navigation between the different demos\nFibonacciComponent is used to display the fibonacci demo. It allows you to generate numbers within the fibonacci sequence, view them, and view which numbers are even/odd numbers in the sequence\nSequenceListComponent is used by the FibonacciComponent to display the complete sequence generated, and their index number within the sequence\n\n\nShoppingCartComponent is created for adding and removing items to a shopping list and showing their total cost, the calculated cost and the total cost plus tax\nCombiningObservablesComponent is a component that shows different ways to combine observables using example input observables.\n\n\n\nServices\nThere are two services contained in this module:\n\nFibonacciService is the service responsible for generating the fibonacci sequence. Contains the Replay Subject that stores the entire sequence, and functions that generate new numbers, pushes them onto the sequence and retrieves old numbers that were previously generated.\nShoppingCartService is the service responsible for storing the state of the shopping cart's total using a Behavior Subject. It contains functions that return observables for the total value, the tax value, and the total after tax values. It also contains functions for adding and subtracting from the total.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/samples/unit-testing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/samples/unit-testing.html","title":"additional-page - Unit Testing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nUnit Test Module\nDemonstrate what we are expecting when creating unit tests for different class types, please give them a read for more in depth understanding:\n\nhttps://angular.io/guide/testing\nhttps://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction\nhttps://github.com/ngneat/spectator\n\nFolder structure of this module loosely follows the Angular style guide.\nModels\nThis module contains serval models:\n\nEchoData used to represent echo data\ninjection-tokens.store.ts for storing the injection tokens used in this module\nECHO_URL is the injection token for echo endpoint URL\n\n\n\nComponents\nUnitTestComponent takes in user input and echo the input back in uppercase. The main purpose of this component is to show how to test a component with dependencies. For more detail please check unit-test.component.spec.ts\nServices\nThis module contains 2 services:\n\nEchoService send input to an echo endpoint and return result as EchoData. This service is created to show how to test a service utilizing a HTTP client. For more detail please check echo.service.spec.ts\nEchoTooService depends on EchoService to receive result from the echo endpoint. This service unwraps EchoData and return the echo string. The main purpose of this service is to show how to test a service that depends on other service.

This module demonstrates the use of both the localStorage and sessionStorage. It should be noted that these are not the only way to store data client side.\nFolder structure of this module loosely follows the Angular style guide.\nSession Storage\nThis storage mechanism maintains a separate storage for each origin within a given page session. This means that data stored until the browser or tab is closed. The maximum amount of data that can be stored using this storage is 5mb and data can only be stored as string values.\nLocal Storage\nLocal storage is similar to the session storage except data is persisted even if the browser is closed. To clear this storage you have to manually clear it. Its limit is also 5mb and it can only store string values.\nComponents\nThis module contains 1 component:\n\nStorageComponent provides a user interface for the user to interact with. Allows the user to make calls to the LocalStorageService and SessionStorageService in order to update, and delete items. It also leverages these services to display their current states to the user.\n\nServices\nThere are two services contained in this module:\n\nLocalStorageService provides functions for getting, updating/adding, and deleting items from local storage.\nSessionStorageService provides functions for getting, updating/adding, and deleting items from session storage.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
