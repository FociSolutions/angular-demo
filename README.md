# Angular Demo

This project contains a collection of demo modules that showcase different techniques and features of Angular development and how to implement them.

## Recommended VSCode Plugins

Since we prefer to use VSCode to implement our Angular application, the following are some VScode plugin recommendations to make the development process a little bit easier:

- Angular Essentials: `johnpapa.angular-essentials`
- Prettier - Code formatter: `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- npm: `eg2.vscode-npm-script`
- npm Intellisense: `christian-kohler.npm-intellisense`
- Node.js Modules Intellisense: `leizongmin.node-module-intellisense`
- Code Spell Checker: `streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker`
- GitLens â€” Git supercharged: `eamodio.gitlens`

The list can also be found in `.vscode/extensions.json` of this solution, please copy `extensions.json` file to other Angular application's `.vscode` folder.
